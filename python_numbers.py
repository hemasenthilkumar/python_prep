Numeric Data Types
- Integers
- Floats
- Complex

Integers
 - whole numbers positive or negative
 - unbounded (they can be large as they want)
 - they cannot start with leading zeros
Floats 
- Fractional numbers postive or negative
- bounded
- they have limits of precision
- they take up more space 
- they can/or not have leading zeros

Numerical Notations
we can use 1_000 for 1,000 (underscores instead of commas) # its purely for human sake and not for python sake
for float as well 1,000.55 => 1_000.55

we can use scientific notation also
1.286e+19 => add that many zeros
6.7e-3 => 0.0067
